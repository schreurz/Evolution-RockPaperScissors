# RockPaperScissors
## Abstract

The study of game theory is about the evaluation of choices and to assess possible outcomes. Studying the advantages and disadvantages of different options in a hypothetical situation, is a useful undertaking, since many real world situations can be expressed within game theory. The gained knowledge can often be applied to other situations. 

Rock paper scissors is classic example within game theory. Here we find two different kinds of strategies: strictly deterministically (only playing rock, paper, or scissors) versus playing randomly. With the rock paper scissors game the win percentage of each strategy turns out to be equally distributed between the deterministic strategies and the random strategy. 

To add another level to this experiment we will allow for actual mutations to strategies, and allow for actual evolution to happen new strategies are inherited from parents. 

To visualize the game, we display a pixelated screen where the pixel colors represent the strategy of a player. This will allow users to get an intuitive understanding, as we are visualizing evolution in action.
